  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <p>
    PickleballFlow (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it.
    This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the PickleballFlow mobile application.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    PickleballFlow is designed to work fully offline. All player lists, game history, and session data are stored
    <strong>locally on your device</strong> and are never uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Analytics and Diagnostics</h2>
  <p>
    To help us improve app performance and stability, PickleballFlow may use
    <strong>Google Firebase</strong> services such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> – to collect anonymous usage information (e.g., feature usage, app opens, screen views).</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> – to report app crashes and technical errors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These services are provided by Google and may collect limited, non-personally identifiable data such as
    device type, operating system, and general usage metrics. You can learn more about how Google handles data in
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All user-entered data (including player names, match results, and session details)
    are stored only on your device. You are responsible for managing, exporting, or deleting this data as needed.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not contain ads or external links. If future versions include optional integrations or links,
    they will be clearly identified and governed by their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    PickleballFlow does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.
    Because the app stores data locally and does not transmit it, we have no access to user information of any kind.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at
    <a href="https://carlevans72.github.io/pickleball-flow/privacy-policy.html">this page</a>.
    Changes take effect immediately upon posting.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at:<br>
